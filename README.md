DrawR
=====
A pure HTML5 client-side offline drawing application

DrawR was created because of my particular interest to make a real drawing (not image editing) application for the web
without requiring a web server (only static files) to be able to act as a real offline application.

It currently supports
* Layers with:
  - opacity
  - visibility of single layers
  - making different layer editable (instead of only topmost)
* different brushes
* graphic tablets (tries to read force property from touch events - was/may not be supported on all browsers)
* line tool
* bucket
* eraser
* colors \o/
